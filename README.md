# Local-Weather
This app shows the weather in the user's location.

## Technology used
- Open Weather API
- HTML5 Geolocation (originally, removed)
- ipinfo.io (updated)
- weather-icons CSS by Erik Flowers

## Getting Started
If your browser prompts you, allow Geolocation to detect your location. The browser takes a couple seconds to get your location and load it into the AJAX call to the Open Weather API.
